/**
 * Forward declaration for Koala noise suppression engine. It enhances an incoming stream of audio in real-time by
 * preserving speech signals and suppressing noise signals. It processes incoming audio in consecutive frames
 * and returns a frame of output audio of the same length, but with a delay of a fixed number of samples. Hence the
 * output of `pv_koala_process` will correspond to samples of audio that were passed to prior calls to that function.
 * The length of the delay in samples can be obtained from `pv_koala_delay_sample()`. The number of samples per frame
 * can be attained by calling `pv_koala_frame_length()`. The incoming audio needs to have a sample rate equal to
 * `pv_sample_rate()` and be 16-bit linearly-encoded. Koala operates on single-channel audio.
